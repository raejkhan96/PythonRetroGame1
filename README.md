# PythonRetroGame1
A retro style game I made using Python and Pygame from a Youtube tutorial.

The game is comprised of 2 spaceships (red and yellow) and is a 1 v 1 game.

The yellow ship is on the left and is controlled by the W,A,S,D keys. 
In order to shoot, the CTRL key on the left must be pressed. 

The red ship is on the right and is controlled by the arrow keys. 
In order to shoot, the CTRL key on the right must be pressed. 

Each ship can only be hit 10 times before the health diminshes to 0.
Each ship can only stay on their respective half of the screen.

Enjoy!
